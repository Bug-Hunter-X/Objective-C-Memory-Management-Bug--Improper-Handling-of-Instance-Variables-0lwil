To rectify the issue, we need to ensure that the object's lifecycle is properly managed.  Using Automatic Reference Counting (ARC), the problem practically vanishes. In non-ARC scenarios, explicit retain/release calls or using properties with appropriate attributes are necessary.  ARC is strongly recommended for new projects.

```objectivec
// Using ARC (recommended):
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSObject *myObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myObject = [[NSObject alloc] init];
}
@end

//Or, using manual retain and release (less preferred):
@interface MyClass : NSObject {
@private
    NSObject *_myObject;
}
@property (nonatomic, retain) NSObject *myObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    _myObject = [[NSObject alloc] init];
    [_myObject retain]; // Manually retain the object
}
-(void)dealloc{
    [_myObject release]; // Manually release in dealloc
    [super dealloc];
}
@end
```
The corrected code ensures that the object's ownership is handled properly, preventing memory leaks and crashes.
