This repository demonstrates a common Objective-C memory management bug and its solution.  The bug involves incorrect handling of object ownership within a class's instance variables. This can lead to memory leaks or crashes if not addressed properly. The solution shows the correct way to manage object ownership and lifetime using appropriate techniques.  This example uses manual reference counting (MRC), although ARC is generally preferred in modern Objective-C development.  Understanding this fundamental concept is crucial for writing stable and robust Objective-C applications.
