In Objective-C, a common yet subtle error arises when dealing with memory management, specifically with regards to object ownership and the intricacies of reference counting.  Consider a scenario where you have a class, 'MyClass', possessing an instance variable, '_myObject', of type 'NSObject *'.  If you create 'MyClass' instances and assign objects to '_myObject' without careful management, memory leaks or crashes may occur. For example:

```objectivec
@interface MyClass : NSObject
@property (nonatomic, strong) NSObject *myObject;
@end

@implementation MyClass
- (void)someMethod {
    self.myObject = [[NSObject alloc] init]; //Object created, but retain count is 1
}
@end

//In another part of the code:
MyClass *myClassInstance = [[MyClass alloc] init];
[myClassInstance someMethod]; //myObject retain count 1
[myClassInstance release]; //myObject retain count 0, memory deallocated
```

The issue is that when `myClassInstance` is released, its `myObject` property is also released. If this object had external references, it would lead to a dangling pointer or unpredictable behavior. If no external references exist, it may be fine, though it's still not best practice.
